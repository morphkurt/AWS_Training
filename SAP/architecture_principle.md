## HA 

Ability recover from a failure

> Example 4x4 with a spare wheel, using the spare wheel recover from failure.
> Auto scaling group in multiple AZ.

## Fault Tolerance

> Example plane with multiple engine.
> FT system needs to survive failures.
> Example RDS database to manage data integrity
> System works through failure.

## DR

Separate process outside of HA and FT. A different system protects critical system data and recreate the system.
